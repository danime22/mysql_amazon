# NODE BAMAZON STORE

This is a collection of node command line applications which simulates a simple online store using a MySQL database to keep track of products for sale and their departments. The applications are:
> node bamazonCustomer.js
Show the user the list of products for sale, prompts them for the item to buy and the quantity and tells them the cost of their order.

> node bamazonManager.js
Allows the user to view the products for sale, view items with low inventory (less than 5 units in stock), add items to inventory, and add new products for sale.

> node bamazonSupervisor.js
Allows the user to view the sales by department including the profit (total sales minus overhead costs) as well as add new departments.




A demonstration of the application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uj_Gl7bLpcA-uPgn2cH6dgF5O4Zw1Iya).
